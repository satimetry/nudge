Surveys
- load tool to populate polls by program for pollq
- reconsider pollq having programid

GAS
- load tool to build gas rules

Tagging
- concept of using rules to tag user created content
- e.g. top link diary and obs entries to goals


Data Download Rule
- add feature that user can request data download, via opt-in/out
- if opt-in appears as links that appears in Resources Link screen, something to obfuscate username
- clicking link triggers building CSV file with all user data
=> need to add feature as "data-download" rule link to rule and programrule/user 


BQL
Build mock example of practitioner creating a dynamic BQL query
Use select, radio, drop downs for EQUALS, GREATER THAN, choose observation
slide for time window etc

Poll
add pollname drop down list to rule creation if ruletype=poll

currenlt only 10 questions per poll, what about dpanas with 14 q?
Ensure no quote marks in questions text, edit openshift database for poll=11
Add poll list page to Architect function
- can apply instant poll to all on click button
- other button steps thru poll without saving to show poll


Rules
for time windoe rules add date day modulo check
to avoid doing daily, e.g. dayno mod 5 = 0 then ...

TODO ...
1. add msgid to programurl
2. change ruleManual type to 'program'
3. git push latest code

need to change rulename in msg to ruleid instead

For surveys
1)
... add a nother field to msg to assopciated programurlid back to msh record
so users see only their surveys, e.g. add msgid to programurl table
2)
reformat programurl to make select cases clearer

Batch processing behavior treated and crontolled like a rule - like everything else

Create implementation for batch processing rules, e.g. sysBatchProc rule drives R script that
automates running the fitbit.R scripts

Manage the batch processing using an R script that operates in a continuous loop?? - as opposed to e.g.
Mac OS/X launchd and launchctl

configurable userobs types


Configure openground sample data set

Host using thenudgemachine.com alias from openshift

Add programruleuser INSERT to register_submit section
- see also add function for architect
-- requires query against rule table to create list of programrules not yet inserted
-- user clicks rule and that triggers new insert to programrule table
--> need programrule page

Add simple likert survey mechanism based on study1 prototype
      
Add site statistics chart to program charts

Add programrule Add function for architect
add programurl Add for architect as plus icon in Link screen
DONE - add if test around role in header

Bugs
- user charts number shows static result even if user has no charts existing
- login as PR63 for fit program and inspect user Chart as example

Help
for each page
Application/Benefit
- help triage those most in need to optimise direction of resources
- explain roles
- minimum requirement, purpose, goal, measurable behaviour

User

Architect
-- add user list screen for participants in architect's program
-- add searchable rule list for architect to review all nudges for his participants
-- add searchable user chart list, see all user's charts

Notifications
- Need to add page refresh so that popup works properly ?? see msg popup show <var> unresolved
- Add unread message count to home page - need table which is updated on click to read ...
- write value to js global variable
- add msg count to programuser
- calculate by update programuser table when user logs in, then set SESSION var to equiv js variable using <script>

IN PROGRESS


Rule
- add types to rule
- user create rules for goals
- add separate rule configuration page
OK
